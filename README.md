# FunCon
Some functions to apply functional connectivity analyses.

The scripts in [ConnMx](https://github.com/zchuri/FunCon/tree/master/ConnMx) folder contain functions to compute connectivity matrices from fMRI files in Matlab and R... however, (and I discovered much later), you can generate these matrices more faster and with less RAM demanding just with the AFNI functions [3dROIstats](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dROIstats.html) plus [3dTcorr1D](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dTcorr1D.html). Never it's too late to discover how to do things simplier :)
